##  Projects

### 3D Platformer Game (Unreal Engine, C++)
- Engineered a 3D environment with player controls, physics, and collision detection.
- Highlighted OOP architecture and optimized real-time game logic.

### 3D Puzzle Game (Unreal Engine, C++)
- Constructed logic-driven puzzles with interactive objects.
- Focused on modular system design and memory-efficient resource management.

---

##  Upcoming Projects (In Progress)
*(Goal: Showcase breadth beyond game dev)*  
- **Library Management System (C++)** â€“ CLI app using file-handling and OOP principles.  
- **To-Do CLI App (Python)** â€“ Task manager with CRUD operations and intuitive CLI interface.

---

##  Data Structures & Algorithms Practice
- Solving 300+ problems across LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and CodeStudio.  
- Practiced with arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

##  How to Use This
1. Make this README your repositoryâ€™s `README.md`.  
2. Create and push your project repos with detailed individual READMEs.  
3. Feel free to add badges (e.g. GitHub stats, languages, etc.) for aesthetic polish.

---

###  Optional Extras (to elevate your portfolio)
- **GitHub activity graph** â€“ Shows consistency.  
- **Pinned repos** â€“ Highlight your best projects upfront.  
- **Tech badges** â€“ Visually display your stack (e.g., shields.io).  
- **Minimalist styling** â€“ Stick to clean formattingâ€”no flashy graphics.

---

###  Next Steps for You
1. Build and push **at least one non-game software project** (Library Manager or To-Do CLI).  
2. Make your Unreal Engine game projects public (even if unfinished).  
3. Populate README sections with project summaries, screenshots, and key learnings.

Let me know if you'd like additional supportâ€”like a step-by-step guide for one of the projects or help with visual enhancements for the README!
